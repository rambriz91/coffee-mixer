# 03- Javascript: Password Generator

## Description

I was provided with starter code to create an app that creates a random password based on user inputs. The app prompts the user to select character sets and password lengths. Once the user makes their selection, the app generates a random password and displays it in the text area.

## Tasks 

- Created a function that allows the user to select the charactersets that they want to include in their password using the confirm() method.
- created a function that prompts the user to input how many characters they want in their password using the prompt() method and another that randomizes the users selection from the charactersets that they chose.
- Created alerts that notifies the user when a password has been created or when password length does not meet the criteria.
- Lastly, I made all functions work with the event listener when Generate Password is clicked.
